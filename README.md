This is the sales analysis of one of the store i.e. **_"Baniya Store"_** the data is imaginary downloaded from kaggle and then I cleaned this data and just taken what is needed for a company sales dashboard.
**_What Data contains-_**-> The data is of 10 years from (2014 to2023), contains orderid, age_group, sales channel, category, sales and many more.
